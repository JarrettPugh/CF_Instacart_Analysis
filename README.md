# CF_Instacart_Analysis

This is a Python project that I created during my Data Analytics bootcamp with CareerFoundry. In this project, I act as an analyst for Instacart and perform exploratory data analysis to give insights and recommendations to the sales and marketing teams to help with customer segmentation.
